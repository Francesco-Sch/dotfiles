This is my literate Emacs configuration file. From here code blocks are extracted and stored in their respected configuration files. This file is also known as "tangling".

Currently this file tangles all code blocks to the =init.el= file. Later I might switch to a setup where decide on a per code block basis to which file I want to extract to. This could be beneficial if I for example want to keep an =early-init.el= setup in this file as well. For now I want to keep it simple.

* Early configuration

** Tangle on Save Hook
This block registers the save hook. It tangles =init.el= so that on the next startup, the hook is re-registered automatically.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun fs-tangle-literate-emacs-config ()
    "Tangle the current org file on save."
    (when (string-equal (buffer-file-name)
                        (expand-file-name "~/.config/emacs/config.org"))
      (let ((org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil))
        (org-babel-tangle))))

  (add-hook 'after-save-hook #'fs-tangle-literate-emacs-config)
#+end_src

* Packages

Here I define all configurations related to extensions and packages.

** Org Mode

*** Base setup

First we need to load the package. It is already integrated with Emacs therefore there is no need to download it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org
    :ensure nil  ; Org is built-in, so we don't need to download it
    :config
  (setq org-ellipsis " ▾"))
#+end_src

*** Appearance

First the lines should wrap. This makes writing and reading easier.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)
#+end_src
